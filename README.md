# hello-world

## Requirements

- Git
- C++ Compiler (gcc, clang, msvc)
- CMake

## Installation

Setting up a C++ development environment can be non-trivial. The course is setup that most relatively stanadard development environments will work fine, whether you are using Window or Linux. Nor do we perscribe that you use a specific editor or that you an editor at all! However for simplicity here we give instructions on how to use VS Code as your editor and setup a C++ development in Linux or Windows. Microsoft provides a thorough [set of instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp), but here we will go through some basics and the most pertinent set of instructions.

### Terminal Basics

Many of the folllowing instructions will require use of a terminal. While it is possible to perform these operations purely within a Graphical User Interface (GUI) you will find that you will often run into programs and tools that have no UI, and must be run via a command line interface (CLI), or even if there is a UI it would be faster to type the necessary commands. The following instructions will be for Windows, as the specific instructions can vary greatly depending on your Linux Distro.

If you are unused to using the terminal here is a brief [introduction](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/).

### Setup

On Windows for this first part you can use either Command Prompt or Powershell as your terminal, which can both be accessed via `Windows Terminal`. Both are acceptable but I would suggest using Powershell.

If you are on Window we will use the utiltiy `winget` to install the required programs. On Linux you can use your system's package manager.

```shell
winget --version
```

First we will install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a version control.

```shell
winget install Git.Git
```

Next we will install a c++ development environment. On Windows developers have the option to eitehr use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) which creates and Unix-like development environment, [Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) which creates an actual Linux system that runs on-top of Windows, or [Microsoft's C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022). If you wish to develop as if you are on Linux, WSL is an option, but we will continue with the Build Tools. While all 3 can be used with VS Code, the build tools can also be used with Microsoft's [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads), which provides a fully integrated development environment. While we are at it we will also install [VSCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads)

```shell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

With the installation of the build tools you now have two new terminals installed. These are the `Developer Powershell for VS 2022` & `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` The c++ development tools are only available while using one of these new terminals. Open one of the termainls and check that your tools are properly installed

```shell
cl
```

```shell
g++
```

```shell
code -v
```

With everything setup we will make a folder to place some new projects, you could do this in Windows Explorer, but let's continue using the terminal. We will also get the this repository

```shell
cd ~
mkdir Repos/School/mctr294
cd Repos/School/mctr294
git clone https://github.com/mctr294-2026/lab-1-UserName helloWorld
code helloWorld
```

## Building

```shell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Debug
build\Debug\hello_world.exe
```

## Testing

[Build](#building)

```shell
ctest --test-dir build -C Debug
Add -V for verbose testing
```
